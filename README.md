# AstroxImperium
Astrox Imperium is a single player indie space game currently in development by Jace Masula. It is available
on GOG and Steam, and there's quite a few videos on Youtube.

Astrox Imperium features a whole universe to explore, and leaves the choice of playstyle to where it belongs: You.
