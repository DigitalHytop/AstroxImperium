The SkyTec Industries (STI) MODPak is a mod for Astrox Imperium that will add many new upper tier ships to the game.  In addition, the pak also adds a new sector, SkyTec Nexus, that populates new stations that add convenient access to the new ships and new Mercenaries for hire. The SkyTec Manufacturing station addition also gives the ability to take on offices of your own.

Please read the INSTALL.md file for installing and setting up this MOD.
