How To Install:

First and foremost, BACK UP YOUR GAME FILES BEFORE you start to do anything with this MOD.

Second, although this MOD may run with other MOD content, it is designed to be run from an unplayed, vanilla
copy of the game's MOD folder.  It will add an additional sector file that will overwrite an existing sector 110,
if you have played through to the point of visiting any spawned wormhole sectors.
