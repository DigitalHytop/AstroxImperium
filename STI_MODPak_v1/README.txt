The SkyTec Industries (STI) MODPak - v1

:: FEATURES ::
This Astrox Imperium MOD will add many new upper tier ships to the game.

In addition:
• adds a new sector, SkyTec Nexus, that populates with 4 new stations
• new stations give access to the new ships
• new stations give access to new Mercenaries for hire
• The SkyTec Manufacturing station additionally gives the ability to take on offices of your own

:: RECOMMENDED INSTALL ::
This MOD Pak is intended to be installed into a vanilla copy of the Astrox Imperium /MOD folder,
but it can be installed into an existing save as well. The latter is only recommended if you are
familiar with Astrox's file structure, and if you are comfortable editing its configuration files.

NOTE:  I have installed this along side Daering's eXperimental MOD located here on Nexus, and haven't seen any structural compatibility issues so far. You MUST install and configure his MOD first. Then substitute the eXperimental/ folder for the MODSkyTec/ folder mentioned in the installation instructions.

Please read the INSTALL Doc for installing and setting up this MOD.

:: ISSUES ::
- Ship balancing tweaks still in order
- Torpedo build Mercs are not loading torpedoes in inventory (per Momo, will be fixed with b144 push)
